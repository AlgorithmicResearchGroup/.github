- [ML-Research-Agent-Tasks](https://github.com/AlgorithmicResearchGroup/ML-Research-Agent-Tasks)
Tasks for ML Research Benchmark, a benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of AI agents in accelerating AI research and development.

- [ML-Research-Agent-Evals](https://github.com/AlgorithmicResearchGroup/ML-Research-Agent-Evals)
Agent-Eval is a library for evaluating the performance of an agent on ML Research Benchmark tasks

### ARIA
- [ARIA](https://github.com/AlgorithmicResearchGroup/ARIA)
ARIA Benchmarks is a suite of closed-book benchmarks designed to assess an LLMs knowledge and understanding of machine learning research and methodologies

### Agent States
- [Agent-States](https://github.com/AlgorithmicResearchGroup/Agent-States)
Agent States is a library designed to manage the state and decision-making processes of AI agents.
